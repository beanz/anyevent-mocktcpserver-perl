AnyEvent::MockTCPServer - Mock TCP Server using AnyEvent

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111070

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AnyEvent::MockTCPServer qw/:all/;
  my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;
  my $server =
    AnyEvent::MockTCPServer->new(connections =>
                                 [
                                  [ # first connection
                                   [ recv => 'HELLO', 'wait for "HELLO"' ],
                                   [ sleep => 0.1, 'wait 0.1s' ],
                                   [ code => sub { $cv->send('done') },
                                     'send "done" with condvar' ],
                                   [ send => 'BYE', 'send "BYE"' ],
                                   # ...
                                  ],
                                  [ # second connection

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a TCP server with a set of defined behaviours for
use in testing of TCP clients.  It is intended to be use when testing
AnyEvent TCP client interfaces.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new(%parameters)>

Constructs a new L<AnyEvent::MockTCPServer> object.  The parameter hash
can contain values for the following keys:

=over

=item C<connections>

A list reference containing elements for each expected connection.
Each element is another list reference contain action elements.  Each
action element is a list with an action method name and any arguments
to the action method.  By convention, the final argument to the action
method should be a description.  See the
L<action method|/ACTION METHODS> descriptions for the other arguments.

=item C<host>

The host IP that the server should listen on.  Default is the IPv4
loopback address, C<127.0.0.1>.

=item C<port>

The port that the server should listen on.  Default is to pick a
free port.

=item C<timeout>

The timeout for IO operations in seconds.  Default is 2 seconds.

=item C<on_timeout>

The callback to call when a timeout occurs.  Default is to die
with message C<"server timeout\n">.

=back

=head2 C<listening()>

Condvar that is notified when the mock server is ready.  The value
received is an array reference containing the address and port that
the server is listening on.

=head2 C<connect_address()>

An array reference containing the address and port that the server is
listening on.  This method blocks on the L</listening()> condvar until
the server is listening.

=head2 C<connect_host()>

The address that the server is listening on.  This method blocks on
the L</listening()> condvar until the server is listening.

=head2 C<connect_port()>

The port that the server is listening on.  This method blocks on
the L</listening()> condvar until the server is listening.

=head2 C<connect_string()>

A string containing the address and port that the server is listening
on separated by a colon, 'C<:>'.  This method blocks on the
L</listening()> condvar until the server is listening.

=head2 C<next_action($handle, $actions)>

Internal method called by the action methods when the server should
proceed with the next action.  Must be called by any action methods
written in subclasses of this class.

=head1 ACTION ARGUMENTS

These methods (and methods added by derived classes) can be used in
action lists passed via the constructor C<connections> parameter.  The
C<handle> and C<actions> arguments should be omitted from the action
lists as they are supplied by the framework.

=head1 ACTION METHODS

=head2 C<send($handle, $actions, $send, $desc)>

Sends the payload, C<send>, to the client.

=head2 C<packsend($handle, $actions, $send, $desc)>

Sends the payload, C<send>, to the client after removing whitespace
and packing it with 'H*'.  This method is equivalent to the
L</send($handle, $actions, $send, $desc)> method when passed the
packed string but debug messages contain the unpacked strings are
easier to read.

=head2 C<recv($handle, $actions, $expect, $desc)>

Waits for the data C<expect> from the client.

=head2 C<packrecv($handle, $actions, $expect, $desc)>

Removes whitespace and packs the string C<expect> with 'H*' and then
waits for the resulting data from the client.  This method is
equivalent to the L</recv($handle, $actions, $expect, $desc)> method
when passed the packed string but debug messages contain the unpacked
strings are easier to read.

=head2 C<sleep($handle, $actions, $interval, $desc)>

Causes the server to sleep for C<$interval> seconds.

=head2 C<code($handle, $actions, $code, $desc)>

Causes the server to execute the code reference with the client handle
as the first argument.
